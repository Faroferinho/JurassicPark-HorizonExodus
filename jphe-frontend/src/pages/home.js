      <p>Welcome to the Jurassic Park Horizon Exodus project!</p>
      <p>
        About 32 years ago now, a visionary man who had a unprecedented talent to touch the public's imagination, 
        changed the way we see dinosaurs forever. John Hammond, the founder of Internation Genectics Incorporates 
        also know InGen, created a theme park like no other, a theme park where the main attraction were real dinosaurs 
        cloned from ancient DNA. The park was called Jurassic Park, and it was located on a remote island 120 miles off
        the west coast of Costa Rica, the small island called Isla Nublar then became the birth place of the infamous
        Jurassic Park.
